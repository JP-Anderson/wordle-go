Plan for how rest server might look

Create a game:

-- POST /game
  username or id in json body
- creates new game
- if active game already exists (in map, not doing DB for now), return error
- if no active game, creates new game and returns user id to locate new game

-- POST /guess
  json{ userId, guessWord }
- find active game for userId (returns error if no active game)
- calls Guess() on game, which returns slice of letter indicators
- response json{ userId, gameStatus guessIndicators, remainingGuesses  }

gameStatus one of [WON, LOST, ACTIVE]

not in scope:
- store old games. when game is finished, we remove it from the map. Future work could include a separate DB for old games
- store active games in DB. games are just stored in an in memory map, which means if the server goes down, games are lost
